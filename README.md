# EPOS DCAT-AP: An extension of the DCAT Application Profile for Research Infrastructures in the solid-Earth domain

The extension is developed and adopted in the framework of the European Plate Observing System (EPOS, https://www.epos-eu.org) in order to capture the diversity and heterogeneity of the assets provided by the EPOS community.

EPOS-DCAT-AP is based on DCAT-AP and uses or extends additional vocabularies (e.g., Schema.org, Hydra).
